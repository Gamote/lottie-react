### Breaking changes
The `ref` property used to export the interaction methods from the Lottie component was renamed in `lottieRef`.
This way we can use the `ref` property to allow the user to control the animation container.

### Changes

- Tests were added
- README.md and docs were updated
- Code refactoring
