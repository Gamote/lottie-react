This project is meant to give developers full control over **[Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/)** instance with minimal implementation by wrapping **[lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web)** in a Component or Hook that can be easily used in **React** applications.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the peer-dependencies installed: `react` and `react-dom`.

    > _**Note:** This library is using React Hooks so the **minimum** version required for both **react** and **react-dom** is **v16.8.0**._

2. Install `lottie-react` using **yarn**

    ```shell
    yarn add lottie-react
    ```
   
    or **npm**

    ```shell
    npm i lottie-react
    ```

## Usage

### Using the component ([try it](https://codesandbox.io/s/lottie-react-component-2k13t))

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Lottie from "lottie-react";
import groovyWalkAnimation from "./groovyWalk.json";

const App = () => <Lottie animationData={groovyWalkAnimation} loop={true} />;

export default App;
```

### Using the Hook ([try it](https://codesandbox.io/s/lottie-react-hook-13nio))

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useLottie } from "lottie-react";
import groovyWalkAnimation from "./groovyWalk.json";

const App = () => {
  const options = {
    animationData: groovyWalkAnimation,
    loop: true
  };

  const { View } = useLottie(options);

  return <>{View}</>;
};

export default App;
```
