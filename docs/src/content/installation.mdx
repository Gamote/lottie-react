You can install Lottie React with [NPM](https://npmjs.com),
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), or a good ol' `<script>` via
[unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

## NPM

```bash
$ npm i lottie-react
# or
$ yarn add lottie-react
```

Lottie React is compatible with React v16.8+ and works with ReactDOM.

## CDN

If you're not using a module bundler or package manager we also have a global ("UMD") build hosted on the [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) CDN. Simply add the following `<script>` tag to the bottom of your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lottie-react@3.0.0/build/index.umd.js"></script>
```

Once you've added this you will have access to the `window.LottieReact` object and its exports.

> This installation/usage requires the [React CDN script bundles](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) to be on the page as well.
